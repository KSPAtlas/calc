# calc
Ridiculosly simple command line calculator, written in bash and uses python.

# How to install

You need Python, then run this:
```git clone https://github.com/TheGamingCoderNoob/calc.git```
then, if you want to have it in path, run this:
```sudo mv calc /usr/local/bin/```
That's all, took me like 5 minutes to make.
