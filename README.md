# calc
Ridiculosly simple command line calculator, written in bash and uses python.

# How to install

You need Python, then run this:
```git clone https://github.com/TheGamingCoderNoob/calc.git```
then, if you want to have it in path, run this:
```sudo mv calc /usr/local/bin/```.

# how to use

For a simple calculation, you can run it like `calc 2+2`.
If you need an external python library like `math`, add it as an argument like `calc "math.sin(90)" math` (note the quotes. This is to stop the shell breaking things.).

May add to this, but for now this is it.
